# Key Takeaways 

* A team's rate of rush shots taken on even-player rushes (e.g. a 2-on-2 rush, when there is no player advantage) are repeatable within seasons

* A team's rate of rush shots taken on rushes with a one player advantage (e.g. a 3-on-2 rush, when there is a one-player advantage) are repeatable within seasons.

* Shooting percentages across the whole season are _significantly higher_ in rushes with one player advantage than even-player rushes.

* Shooting percentages on all types of rushes (e.g. even-player, one player advantage, etc) are not repeatable within seasons.

* *In other words, generating rush shots is a repeatable skill, while converting these opportunities to goals is not repeatable*

* The lane of a primary pass does not help explain the discrepancy in repeatability of shooting percentages in odd man rushes.

* Rebound shots and rebound shooting percentages (percentage of rebound goals scored) are not repeatable over a given season.

# Introduction

![(Borrowed from https://theprovince.com/sports/hockey/nhl/vancouver-canucks/the-provies-horvat-powers-up-trade-talk-reaction-stecher-rises-playoffs-baby-and-showing-you-the-way-to-san-jose)](tram-rush.gif)

This game was played on January 25th, 2017 between the Vancouver Canucks and the Colorado Avalance at Pepsi Center. In this offensive rush, Loui Eriksson, #21, carries the puck up the ice. Nikita Tryamkin, #88, outskates Mikko Rantanen, #96, to get to the net and create an dangerous opportunity while the lone defender, Cody Goloubef, #18, sprawled to futilely prevent the pass.

When you look at this offensive rush, do you ever wonder about the numbers behind it? For example, is the number of shots repeatable over an entire season? What about shooting percentages? If they are repeatable, do zones of the primary pass (the pass preceding a shot) influence this repeatability? What about rebounds and rebound shooting percentages (the goals scored from rebounds)?

## Terminology

In hockey, "odd-man rushes" is a term frequently used to refer to offensive attacks such as the above where the attacking team has more players than the defending team. In my analysis, I will be slightly deviating from this jargon and instead use "odd player rushes". These rushes consist of even players (1 on 1, 2 on 2, 3 on 3, etc), one player advantages (Breakaways, 2 on 1, 3 on 2, 4 on 3), and two or more player advantages (2 on 0, 3 on 1, 4 on 2, 3 on 0). I summarized these various rush situations into three categories because each situation had small sample sizes.


## Data

To investigate these questions, I will be using the Passing Project Data from the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 NHL seasons organized by [Ryan Stimson](https://twitter.com/RK_Stimp) and [Corey Sznajder](https://twitter.com/ShutdownLine). The data was collected by a group of volunteers who tracked every pass leading to a shot. According to Ryan's [MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference paper](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1614.pdf), "Each tracker was required to complete 2 - 3 training games for validation by the project leader to ensure consistency in classification of passes and recording of data. Occasional spot-checking of games was also conducted."

There are 44 variables and over 150,000 observations in this dataset. Some notable variables that I will be using for my analysis include shot_on_goal (1 for yes and 0 for no), goal (1 for yes and 0 for no), odd_man (number of players involved in player advantages during rushes), shooting_percentage (number of goals / number of shots on goals), shot_type (one-timer, slap shot, wrist/snap shot, backhand, etc), a1_zone (zone that the primary assist originated), and rebound_shot_on_goal (if a rebound occured and resulted in a shot on goal). The "All Other Shots" category in odd_man refers to rush shots with no player advantage, non-rush shots, other types of shots, just no rush shots with a player advantage.

There are two analysis based upon this datset; [Ryan Stimson's paper](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1614.pdf) discusses repeatability of certain metrics on a team level and player level. [A NHL Numbers post](https://www.nhlnumbers.com/2016/08/10/passing-project-dangerous-primary-shot-contributions) covers repeatability of passes that crosses through the royal road (the line that goes directly through the middle of the ice from one net to the other) and provides visualizations. 

In this analysis, I will look at repeatability of shots taken during rushes with player advantages, shooting percentages, rebound shots, and rebound shooting percentages in 5v5 situations.

## Visual Identification of Linear Regression Graphs and Repeatability 

My main analysis tools are scatterplots and linear regression lines. I've grouped the data by teams and plotted the first half statistics from the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 seasons on the x-axis, the second half statistics from the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 season the on the y-axis, and generated a smoothed line with a confidence band: A 95% confidence interval on the slope of the regression line. 

* If I can draw a horizontal line through the confidence bands, this means there exists a regression line with a slope of 0. This further indicates that there is _no significant relationship between the x-variable and the y-variable._
* If I can not draw a horizontal line through the confidence bands, this means that a regression line with a slope of 0 falls outside the 95% confidence band. In other words, there is _a significant relationship between the x-variable and the y-variable._

In this analysis, I designated the midpoint of each of the three seasons as Jan 1st.  All the games before that date are labelled as the first half of the season while the games after that date are labelled as the second half. In terms of the linear regression graphs, the x-variable is a statistic from the first half of the season and the y-variable is a statistic from the second half of the season. As a result, we are really examining the relationship between the past and future of a statistic, or the _repeatability_ of a statistic.



# Repeatability of Odd-Man Rush Shots

```{r}
### Note:At this point, I realized that the number of rows of teams did not match the number of rows of urls of team logos, so I decided to create a function

# Create a function to match number of rows of team logos urls to number of rows for each team
match_logo <- function(df) {
  # Configure team logos to match values in odd_man
  team_freq <- as.data.frame(table(df[["team"]]))
  empty_list <- list()
  for (ii in seq(nrow(team_freq))) {
    empty_list[[ii]]<- rep(team_logo[ii], times =  team_freq[,2][ii])
  }
  
  return(as.vector(unlist(empty_list)))
}
```


```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4.5}
# Let's add on team logo urls to pass_odd_man
pass_odd_man <- pass_odd_man %>% 
  mutate(team_logo_url = match_logo(pass_odd_man))

# Let's change the labels on the facets:
odd_man <- list(
  "all_other_shots" = "All Other Shots",
  "one_man" = "One Player Advantage",
  "two_plus_man" = "Two+ Player Advantage"
)

odd_man_labeller <- function(variable,value){
  return(odd_man[value])
}

```


* Shots taken on rushes are repeatable over a season when there is a one player advantage (Breakaways, 2 on 1 rushes, 3 on 2 rushes, and 4 on 3 rushes). 
* This leads me to think that its increadibly hard to predict the number of shots in two-plus player advantages (2 on 0 rushes", 3 on 1 rushes, 4 on 2 rushes, 3 on 0 rushes) over a season. 
* Perhaps, teams with an incredible advantage in rushes have too many options at their disposal, and thus these rushes do not always result in shots on net. 
* Rather, they could make one extra pass that extinguishes the offensive threat or the extra pass could be intercepted by the defender(s). 
* *As there is _no repeatability_ in two plus player advantage, I will ignore these situations for this analysis.*


# Repeatability of Shooting Percentage

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4.5}
pass_shooting_percentage <- pass_final %>%
  filter(strength == "5v5") %>% 
  mutate(odd_man = ifelse(odd_man %in% c("1-0", "2-1", "3-2", "4-3"), "one_man", 
                                 ifelse(odd_man %in% c("2-0", "3-1", "4-2", "3-0"), "two_plus_man",
                                        "all_other_shots"))) %>%

  )) %>% 
  group_by(team, season, half, odd_man) %>% 
  # Calculate the shooting percentage, defined as the number of goals over the number of shots on goal
  summarise(shooting_percentage = 100 * (sum(goal) / sum(shot_on_goal))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(team), !is.na(half)) %>%
  spread(key = half, value = shooting_percentage) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(team_logo_url = match_logo(.))

# Ignore two_plus_man
pass_shooting_percentage %>% 
  filter(odd_man != "two_plus_man", odd_man != "NA") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = first, y = second)) +
  geom_image(aes(image = team_logo_url), size = 0.06)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +

```

* The scales for the two facetted graphs are vastly different: shooting percentages across the whole season are _significantly higher_ in one player advantage rushes than *all other shots*, which is reasonable given the offensive freedom players have. 
* Interestingly, shooting percentages are indeed not repeatable over a season *all other shots* since I can draw a horizontal graph through the confidence band. 
* Shooting percentages are also not repeatable during one player advantage rushes as I can draw a horizontal graph through the confidence band.
* I conclude that teams that have had extremely low shooting perentages in the first half need not panic as their luck may turn in the second half. On the other hand, teams with extremely high shooting percentages are not guaranteed to enjoy this in the second half!

* None of these graphs show any signs of repeatability since I can draw a horizontal line through all these graphs.

* This graph clearly shows that rebound shots are not repeatable over a given season. 
* This suggests that rebounds are intrinsically hard to predict over an entire season. Teams face different styles of goaltenders and even different goaltenders if the team plays its backup or AHL goaltender.


# Repeatability of Rebound Shooting Percentage

To dig deeper into the effectiveness of rebounds in offensive situations, I've defined _rebound shooting percentage as the percentage of rebound goals scored._ Let's now examine its repeatability.

```{r}
pass_final %>% 
  filter(strength == "5v5") %>% 
  mutate(half = case_when(
    date <= as.Date("2016-01-01") ~ "first",
    date > as.Date("2016-01-01") & date < as.Date("2016-07-01") ~ "second",
    date >= as.Date("2016-10-01") & date <= as.Date("2017-01-01") ~ "first",
    date > as.Date("2017-01-01") & date < as.Date("2017-07-01") ~ "second",
    date >= as.Date("2017-10-01") & date <= as.Date("2018-01-01") ~ "first",
    date > as.Date("2018-01-01") & date <= as.Date("2018-07-01") ~ "second"
  )) %>%  
  group_by(team, season, half) %>% 
  summarise(rebound_percentage = 100 * (sum(rebound_goal) / sum(rebound_shot_on_goal))) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(team), !is.na(half)) %>% 
  spread(key = half, value = rebound_percentage) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(team_logo_url = match_logo(.)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = first, y = second)) +
  geom_image(aes(image = team_logo_url), size = 0.04, by = "height") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "First Half Rebound %",
       y = "Second Half Rebound %") +
  ggtitle("Repeatability of Rebound Shooting %")
```

* Overall, rebound shooting percentages are not repeatable since I can draw a horizontal line through the confidence band. 
* This again suggests that rebounds are a random occurence during a hockey game. 
* Furthermore, over an entire season, there exist unpredictable offensive situations that lead to rebounds and thus, make it impossible to predict.

# Conclusion

As seen in this analysis, hockey is a very unpredictable sport. Shots taken in two player advantage rushes, shooting percentages, rebound percentages, and rebound shooting percentages all change from the first half of a season to the second half. This signifies that a team that may have a horrible record before January 1st still can bounce back to become one of the league's best teams. Just look at the [2018 Arizona Coyotes](https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nhl/coyotes/2018/04/08/tale-two-seasons-how-coyotes-turned-around-second-half/497308002/). On Dec 31st, the Coyotes were 9-26-5 and were last in the league. "But since Feb. 8, only four NHL teams had more points than Arizona over than span." The conclusion drawn from this analysis of different offensive statistics helps explain the resurgence of the Arizona Coyotes in the second half. 

I would like to thank my mentor of the [Hockey Graphs Mentorship Program](https://hockey-graphs.com/2017/08/21/hockey-graphs-mentorship-program/), Sam Ventura, for his advice.
